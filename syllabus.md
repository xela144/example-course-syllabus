# Capstone Design Course I
## Course Description
Course Description:

This Senior Capstone Design course offers a culminating experience for students in Electrical and Computer Engineering. Over a 10-week quarter, students will engage in comprehensive, hands-on projects that integrate theoretical knowledge with practical application. Emphasizing collaboration, innovation, and industry-academia synergy, the course guides students through all stages of project design â€“ from conception to implementation. Students will work closely with faculty and industry experts, leveraging state-of-the-art tools and methodologies like open-source platforms and IoT technologies. This course prepares graduates for real-world engineering challenges, fostering skills in teamwork, problem-solving, and project management.

## Policies
### Attendance
 Attendance is mandatory. There will be quizzes at the beginning of each class covering the material from the preceding week. Do not miss out on the opportunity for easy grade credits!
### Cheating
Academic dishonesty is a serious violation and will result in a zero on an assignment, and a lowered grade in the course. Students will be reported to the Dean of Undergraduate Education. https://ue.ucsc.edu/academic-misconduct.html
